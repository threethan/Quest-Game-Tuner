<p>Quest Game Tuner improves your standalone VR experience by automatically adjusting hidden system parameters to improve resolution, framerate, and more - for all your VR Apps and games. <br></p>
<p><strong>Meta limits the performance of apps. <em>Quest Game Tuner </em>breaks those limits, letting you get the most of the hardware you already own.</strong><br></p>
<p>You can also capture better videos, block ads, keep your headset from draining battery when not in use,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Tuning Profiles</strong> automatically optimize any VR app or game for your choice of smooth <em>performance </em>with improved fps, crystal-clear <em>visual clarity </em>with increased resolutions, or balanced <em>battery saving</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Auto-Tuning uses highly-optimized AI which runs completely on your headset.<br></em></p>

<p>When you set up <em>Quest Game Tuner</em>, every app will be automatically tuned for performance. You can separately optimize each app, or set them all at once using the <strong>Default </strong>profile.</p>
<p>Using custom tuning settings, you can manually adjust <em>horizontal & vertical resolution, FPS target, foveation level, CPU & GPU levels</em>, and <em>lens correction</em>. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p>

</p>
<p>Plus, further improve your recordings with <em>side-by-side 3D-capture </em>and <em>exclusive stabilization options</em>. <br></p>

<p><strong>Quest 2</strong> & <strong>Quest Pro</strong> users can expect significant increases in resolution or framerate for most games. These headsets will be automatically overclocked, allowing you to reach Quest 3 settings in many titles.
</p>
<p><strong>Quest 3</strong> & <strong>Quest 3S</strong> users can expect significant increases to framerates <em>and</em> resolutions in Quest 3-optimized games, and even more drastic improvements in older titles. These headsets have twice the processing power as the Quest 2, and can often reach PCVR-like settings when fully utilized.
</p>
<p><em>Quest 1 users should expect minimal, if any, improvements.<br></em></p>

<p><strong>All VR Applications</strong> can be automatically or manually tuned in Quest Game Tuner. You can also tune the home environment, which can improve your experience when using 2D apps on the headset.
</p>
<p><em>2D apps cannot be individually tuned, but you can make them visible to be searched and launched. </em><br></p>

<p><strong>Yes, as long as they use VR. </strong>Auto-tuning works best on unmodified apps from the Meta Quest Store or SideQuest. Highly modified or homebrew apps may work better with custom tuning settings.</p>

<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> While Quest Game Tuner can cause your hardware to run at elevated performance levels, these levels are within specifications and are totally safe. Your headset may get warm or drain it's battery faster, though. <br></p>
<p><em>In the unlikely case that your headset is unable to cool itself, it  will lower performance or shut down before it is able to overheat.

<p>Use the <strong>Don't Tune <em>(App Decides All)</em></strong> profile to disable tuning for a specific app. Set it to the default tuning profile to disable tuning for all apps on the default profile.</p>
<p><em>This will still let you tune specific apps and use Quest Game Tuner's other features. </em><br><br></p>
